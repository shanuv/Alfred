Love this Product!,"I purchased the Indigo Marble Protective Camera Cover for use with my Nikon D90.  While I have a camera bag, I rarely use it and tend to put my camera in my purse or backpack.  My poor D90 was getting slung around without any kind of protection.  I recently broke the LCD screen protector  inside my purse so when I had the opportunity to purchase and test this product at a reduced price in exchange for a review, I jumped all over it!<br /><br />The product is very straight forward and easy to use.  You simply center your camera on the wrap and fold each corner in, one at a time.  I have a strap on my camera so I just leave it out when I fold it.  I LOVE the layer of protection it affords my camera without having to carry another bag.<br /><br />I've also used this when packing my son's iPad in his backpack (it only has a back cover, not over the screen).  It's proven to be quite versatile!",8/14/2015

I love that they thought of everything BUT the case.<br /><br />I wanted something that was easy for her to use and was safe to put in our backpack. This was the perfect solution! I know it's meant for cameras (which it is excellent for), but I was so happy with how it worked for our tablet. It is easy enough for our oldest to place in the middle and secure 3 zelcro tabs. It holds it nicely without having to worry about her screen being scratched. It also has a lining in it that seems like it would do well if the outside got a little wet.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend it!<br /><br />I did recieve this at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",8/13/2015

Sometimes when hiking with kids it isn't convenient or just wanting to grab my camera and stick it in my hand ba. This cover makes it much easier to do that without a lot of bulk.<br /><br />I have a nikon with the 50 lens and it packs up nicely. There is a extra padded square on the bottom where the camera is sitting that gives it more protection. I can either wrap my strap around my camera and fold up the case or leave the strap hanging from outside of one corner. When I put it in my purse I prefer to put my strap out as it makes it much easier for me to get the camera out of my bag.<br /><br />I also fly quit regurally so having this extra protection when I pack my camera really puts me at ease. As careful as I try to be travelling with camera gear isn't always uneventful. I'm so happy I recieved a discount for this product for an honest review so I can get the larger one for my longer lens,8/9/2015

She saved her money last year and purchased her own camera. I bought her a case, but I found that she hasn't been using it because it's too bulky. So when the Indigo Marble Protective Camera Cover was available during a recent promotion, I couldn't wait to order it! When it first arrived, she wasn't quite sure what to think of it. Then I explained what it was and how it worked. The look on her face when she &#34;got it&#34; was priceless! Since she doesn't like using her case, she has been wrapping her camera up in a small towel when she takes it places. This wrap is way better than using a towel! First of all, the material is designed for use with cameras and equipment so it's not going to scratch or harm it. The Velcro corners keep it wrapped in place. The pad is even water proof so you can set the camera safely on moist ground. My daughter absolutely loves it!<br /><br />I purchased this camera cover at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.",8/3/2015

We don't always use a dedicated camera bag and so this is the perfect way to make sure that the camera is still protected in whatever bag it ends up in, or even just while sitting in the car or stroller, etc.  the material is soft but thick and sturdy - I could actually see using this wrap for many things besides my camera and plan to buy another for my tablet.  It's great cushioning for a suitcase or a carryon bag. the warp is generously sized for my needs and folds up in a very small manner so it's easy to tote along when you are using the camera.  I received this discounted as part of a promotion but was very happy to do so as this has been one of the most simple but useful products I have purchased for my camera.",8/2/2015

The larger one provides more protection, the smaller one makes the whole package very compact as it just big enough to for my camera with this fairly large lens.<br /><br />The wrap provides me a quicker access to my camera than a camera case, so I like it when I am doing shooting in the rain or dust to keep the camera protected when I am not shooting.<br /><br />So which one do I use more often?
