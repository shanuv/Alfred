While I have a camera bag, I rarely use it and tend to put my camera in my purse or backpack.  My poor D90 was getting slung around without any kind of protection.  I recently broke the LCD screen protector  inside my purse so when I had the opportunity to purchase and test this product at a reduced price in exchange for a review, I jumped all over it!<br /><br />The product is very straight forward and easy to use.  You simply center your camera on the wrap and fold each corner in, one at a time.  I have a strap on my camera so I just leave it out when I fold it.  I LOVE the layer of protection it affords my camera without having to carry another bag.<br /><br />I've also used this when packing my son's iPad in his backpack (it only has a back cover, not over the screen).  It's proven to be quite versatile!",

There is a extra padded square on the bottom where the camera is sitting that gives it more protection.

When I put it in my purse I prefer to put my strap out as it makes it much easier for me to get the camera out of my bag.<br /><br />I also fly quit regurally so having this extra protection when I pack my camera really puts me at ease.

I bought her a case, but I found that she hasn't been using it because it's too bulky. So when the Indigo Marble Protective Camera Cover was available during a recent promotion, I couldn't wait to order it! When it first arrived, she wasn't quite sure what to think of it. Then I explained what it was and how it worked. The look on her face when she &#34;got it&#34; was priceless! Since she doesn't like using her case, she has been wrapping her camera up in a small towel when she takes it places. This wrap is way better than using a towel! First of all, the material is designed for use with cameras and equipment so it's not going to scratch or harm it. The Velcro corners keep it wrapped in place. The pad is even water proof so you can set the camera safely on moist ground. My daughter absolutely loves it!<br /><br />I purchased this camera cover at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.",

It's great cushioning for a suitcase or a carryon bag. the warp is generously sized for my needs and folds up in a very small manner so it's easy to tote along when you are using the camera.
