It does it's job OK in most instances but the motor does not have the power nor the longevity of a Dremel. If you need to do one little project this will be fine. No doubt Dremel is way overpriced, too. The bits alone make this worth the price. But here's the issues I've had:1) Original purchase had broken latches - replaced no problem at store2) Original purchase had problem with mini tool, spun off center - replaced no problem at store3) Claims that it works with all Dremel accessories - UNTRUE! - probably works with most bits but DOES NOT interchange with collects, flex shaft, or other attachments4) LED light can not be used with flex shaft5) Motor is underpowered and will bog down when drilling with an 1/8&#34; bit in soft plastic6) Collets - changing them is horrible and they don't even have all the sizes needed to use all of the included accessories7) Motor speed is inconsistent even when there is no loadSo, again, you get what you pay for. It's a lot of pieces for the price and will work great for a small project or two. But, if you need to change bits regularly then look elsewhere. And the handy Dremel screw chuck collect DOES NOT fit on here, nor do any other Dremel collects. This tool has a slightly larger diameter where the collect nut attaches both on the main tool and on the business end of the flex shaft. I've heard rumors of and adapter but have yet to find one.",

The unit itself is generally well constructed, with balanced capacities for the motor, compressor and tank. Assembly consisted only of the simple mounting of the wheels, air filters and cart handle. The only glitch with the assembly was the failure of a tack weld on one of the nuts that secures the cart handle. Also on the down side, the unit comes wired to operate on 110V, but no instruction is included for configuring it to run on the optionally offered 220V. Having to pay shop time for an electrician to reconfigure the wiring will negate the cost advantage of this compressor over similar units offered elsewhere. Apart from these non-critical elements, the compressor is well made and, since I don't intend to use it to run continuous demand tools such as air sanders, its performance satisfies all of my needs.",

        "review_body": "My first impression of this unit upon my initial use of it is that it is about the best compressor performance for the price (price per listed CFM at 90 psi - when compared against similar performing units by Ingersoll-Rand, Craftsman, Makita and Industrial Air) that I think one could expect before going to a larger unit wired for 220/240 or gas-powered.  This unit is the perfect choice for the homeowner looking for an upgrade to a smaller pancake or other portable unit.  Assembly was simple and was essentially complete after bolting on the wheels and attaching the handle.  Order the compressor oil also unless you want to make a separate trip to Home Depot or Lowe's to get that before you can plug it in and turn it on.  I was particularly intrigued to see just how quiet it would be, as that was noted in the product details and one feature that mattered to me.  It is indeed quiet compared to the little screamer portable that I had been using.  The dark charcoal, fine-wrinkle finish on the unit appears very durable and was frankly more appealing to me than a typical painted finish.  Other thoughtful details on this compressor include a properly located air-release valve at the bottom of the tank near the right side that make it very simple to open and drain off any moisture or excess air before storage.  If I had a gripe, it'd be that the air-connector is immediately connected to the gauge, and that made it a little more difficult to unscrew the connector from the gauge-body so that I could hard pipe a filter/separator in-line before the connector.  This is due to the lack of a good purchase-point to stick a wrench that will allow for removal of the connector fitting from the gauge-body, as the gauge-dial makes it too tall to allow one to rotate it with the gauge still on it and unscrew it from the unit.  Anyway, the issue won't likely affect anyone not needing particularly dry air.  Finally, although I would guess that NorthStar imports this unit (from Puma perhaps),as the bolts are all metric and don't appear to be quite up to that of American ASTM grade threads.  Frankly, these are relatively little things and wouldn't deter me from strongly recommending this compressor to any friend looking for the same things that I was - good performance for the homeowner-level user for the best price.  Great unit here from NorthStar!",

        "review_body": "I've owned a number of knives, from $400 Fallknivens to $20 Gerbers, and plenty in-between.  I just took delivery of my first Opinel (oh-peen-el, in case you were wondering) 3 days ago, and I am very impressed. I did a lot of reading on these before I made my purchase, and really I could not be happier. Let's get the first bit out of the way, from an aesthetic point, this will be one of the most beautiful knives you will ever own. It's rustic and simplistic appearance belies its strength and capability. The beech wood handle is gorgeous, and has a nice shape, which is very comfortable to hold. I didn't buy this knife to impress others, but it has to be said, every time I have offered it up for another's request of &#34;anybody have a knife?&#34; The next word usually heard is &#34;wow&#34;.It's very light, yet balanced. The blade has zero play on any axis when deployed, and locks confidently in or out. The blade wasn't shaving sharp out of the box, but fairly close, and easy enough to bring up to standard with a dry stone. Being the knife that it is, there are no clips or loops to attach to anything, but it hardly matters. It's quite small enough to slide into the coin pocket of your Levi's and stay secure throughout the day.I have rather large hands, so I included a photo of the #7 Opinel on my iPad for a sizing reference. I was torn between 7 or 8, but I could not be happier with the 7 as my EDC. I believe the 8 will be a bit too large for coin pocket carry, and I prefer not to have a large knife in my front pocket where it is visible to others. I will be ordering more sizes very soon, as there is a size and style for most anyone out there, and at these price points, why not? $14 with shipping is an absolute steal for such a quality knife. And even if you don't like it, you can always gift it to someone who would appreciate it, and you wouldn't feel too bad about losing those 14 dollars.Hope you enjoy your new Opinel!",
