But after reading the Fiery Cross, I was a bit let down, as many people were, and afraid that the rest of the series would just continue to go downhill.  So when A Breath of Snow and Ashes came out, I was so glad to see that it was getting good reviews.  I finally got to read it this week and was not disappointed in the least. <br />All the characters we know and love are back, and Brianna seems to have finally grow up.  She has been my least favorite character since the second book, but this time around she was actually likeable (for the most part).  At certain points this book became so intense that I actually had to put it down and take a break for awhile, but not all readers will have this experience, only ones that are practically obsessed with this series (and who's friends have to remind them, \\""Jamie is NOT a real person!).    <br />So basically, if you have read the previous books, just read this one. Please.  You won't regret it.  The only reason I didn't give this one five stars is that I think nothing can top Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber.  If I could give this 4.5, I would. <br /> <br />One thing I have wondered about - if Claire dies back in the 1700's, then she'll be born again in 1918, go back in time in 1946, die in the 1700's, be born in 1918, and just keep repeating this forever.  For all she knows this could be her tenth time doing this.  I haven't seen this matter dealt with in the books.  Did I just miss it or something?",10/14/2005

It's another great story with wonderful characters we've come to know and love.   <br /> <br />I re-read the earlier books just before Snow & Ashes was published, and must admit that the series struck me a little bit like an old movie serial--with perilous situation after perilous situation.  And read back-to-back like that, it got a tad tedious, though I was pleased that in this book neither Claire nor Jamie were in mortal peril until after page 200.  On the whole, though, I found it a good mix of the exciting and the mundane.  (Unlike some reviewers in this forum, I very much like the depiction of details of their everyday life, and the ways Claire brings a little 20th-century medicine to 18th-century North Carolina.) <br /> <br />I don't quite understand the cries of \\""Cliffhanger. Aaagghh!\\"" I've seen here.  I thought the ending was very straight-forward with no major questions left unanswered (except, perhaps, how Roger and Brianna afford their new real estate).  Perhaps I am taking things too much at face value, but I thought many more old questions were answered than new ones asked. <br /> <br />There were some quibbles with the book--I found Jocasta's behavior revealed at the end rather unbelievable, for example--but on the whole I thought it was a great volume.  I, too, enjoyed seeing old friends like Ian and Lord John, and watching Claire and Jamie's relationship mature and develop.  I can't imagine any fan of the series being disappointed in this book.",10/13/2005

This one is, I hate to say it, worse, but for diffrent reasons. <br /> <br />A 55 year old woman is raped and then rescued by her husband. His first thought is to have sex with her in case she's fallen pregnant by her attackers. She seems to think this is a good idea. How offensive is this? Let me count the ways. <br /> <br />Rape isn't about sex, first of all. It's about violence. Jamie doesn't understand that, which might be expected given his time and place, but you'd think Claire would set him straight. You'd also think that her general health and state of mind would be more important to him than any worries about pregnancy. In a purely biological sense, I assume Claire is not exempt from menopause just because she time travels.  Most of all I just can't accept the idea of her being raped, and then being interested in sex with a husband who is so callous and self centered. If that is true to Jamie's character, I don't like what he's become. <br /> <br />Also, I can't believe I'm the only person disturbed by the general homophobia.   Claire suggests that John Gray is interested in Jamie's son because of the resemblance. This is a stereotype more destructive than most, that gay men are all interested in young boys. I had to read the passage a couple times before I could believe what I was reading. If that is true to Clair's character, I don't like what she's become. <br /> <br />In short, I don't like what has become of any of the characters or the series as a whole, and I'm saddened by the decline of the story.",10/13/2005

Like others, i was not blown away by FC when I read it -- the first time.  But last month when time was ticking down to the publishing date for Breath of Snow and Ashes, i thought i would give it a re-read (normally i start the entire series over again, but i think i can resite most of the first few books by now...) I have to say, reading Fiery Cross the 2nd time -- i actually liked it much better than the first time.  I felt i got more out of it and it led me right into this book, so i am glad i re-read it.  <br />   <br />Breath of Snow and Ashes was great, and as others have said nearly as good as the first books.  I enjoyed Brianna coming into her own as a woman and her struggle to keep some the 20th century in her life.   It was good to see some excitement again with Claire and see Jamie continue to show his love and commitment.   I was very glad to see Ian back, he too is one of my favorite characters.    <br /> <br />The growth in Roger was some of the best part of the book and clever on Ms Gabaldon's part because it happened casually and deep into the book, you recognized he was finally comfortable in the past and has started to become Jamie's equal well, except maybe in the love scenes.. but what are you gonna do, Jamie and Claire are pushing 60, how much more bodice ripping can they do? <br /> <br />I purposely did not read any reviews until after i finished the book, so it was mixed feelings for me when it ended -- glad there was more, but kind of miffed as i read it til nearly the end believeing this was the last book.  Like others, i kept waiting for sample scenes i had read on line over the last couple of years.   But, ok the trade off of 1 or 2 more books -- totally worth it.   <br /> <br />Thank you Ms Gabaldon for a great read, thanks for tieing up some loose ends and bringing us right up to the Revolution, very clever.  Claire knows it is coming, Jamie knows it coming and we know it is coming.  Now I cant wait tosee who they meet along the way to freedom.  Make it happen soon!!",10/12/2005

While I didn't pan the Fiery Cross as much as most, it was a bit slow but picked up halfway through.  This book, however, just grabs you and runs.   <br /> <br />Although I feel largely inadequate cricitizing writing that is obviously of such tremendous quality, I am compelled as a true \\""Gabaldonofile\\"" to be honest.  While it was nice to see the focus shift back to the main characters, I did find a few things unbelievable.  (Although if one were to be honest, couldn't we argue that the entire story is such?)  :)   <br /> <br />SPOILER:  This time it was Claire's turn to be hovering near death instead of Jamie.  The kidnapping segment was awesome, and I couldn't help but get goosebumps when Jamie says, \\""It is I who kills for her.\\""  (Although to be fair, Jamie, she has done a pretty good job of killing when she's needed to both without and for you.)   <br /> <br />SPOILER:  Claire's bout with fever was also very exciting, although it seemed like Jamie and especially Brianna were almost, well, nonchalant.  I know that many might disagree, as the author goes out of her way to show Jamie's concern (shadows under the eyes and tears), but it just seemed odd to me that he would be out there splitting kindling and performing every day tasks while the love of his life was dying; he was in his study whilst Malva (had a hard time buying that whole \\""apprentice of the heart\\"" storyline) was making eyes at him; why wasn't he up with Claire?  I guess one might say that Gabaldon portrays convincingly that life goes on no matter what, but darn it, Claire barely left his side through his (can it be only 5?) illnesses and near death experiences.  And we only got one brief touching scene with Brianna after Claire was on the road to recovery, although I suppose the assumption is that she she couldn't endanger her children in the sickroom.   <br /> <br />Again, SPOILER ALERT:  The goodbye scene at the end, particularly Jamie and Brianna, left a lump in my throat, but it also seemed a bit, well, abrupt.   <br /> <br />For the Lord's sake, Diana, please don't leave us hanging about William!  I found myself reading ahead to get to that part, having read the scene a year ago.  I cannot wait until the next installment. <br /> <br />Anyway, these are trifling matters.  Overall, this is an excellent read.  Far be it from me (a mere mortal) to question this author's choices.  But I think many of these reviews show how many of us feel such ownership of these characters.  Towards the end of the book I began feeling a bit sad; I'll have to wait another three years or so (or more!) to find out what happens to these people that I have been reading about for 11 years.  While it's rather embarassing to admit this, I feel as though Jamie and Claire have become friends of mine, and I am loath to part with them, which I think, says it all.   <br /> <br />Keep up the good work, Diana.  Your writing has really had a positive influence in my life.   <br />",10/11/2005

I envy those who loved this disappointing installment of an epic series.<br /><br />I adored all of the previous books in the Outlander series, and I even liked The Fiery Cross, unlike so many others.  But I have only read 100 pages of \\""A Breath of Snow and Ashes\\"" and I am appalled.  I am not even sure I want to finish it and risk tarnishing my affection for all of Ms. Gabaldon's other tales.  SPOILERS ahead (though minor).<br /><br />What I find most disturbing is the crassness of the narrative and the apparant disregard for the history of the characters.<br /><br />SPOILERS:  The scene where Roger forces (albeit drunkenly) himself on Brianna - with Jem nestled sleeping at her side - and Brianna's response to it was astonishing.  Did \\""The Fiery Cross\\"" not devote HUNDREDS of pages detailing the deep-seated emotional scars left by Stephen Bonnet's rape of Brianna????? Is this the same Roger who before always sensitively and tenderly restrained his lust in respect of her scars? Does this not matter to Roger anymore?  Does it no longer bother Brianna?  If so... HOW? WHY?  WHAT HAPPENED?<br /><br />And the late-night visit of the Cherokee girls to Jamie while he and Ian were visiting... Ian's amusement struck me as improbable, as did (devoutly Catholic and deeply committed)Jamie's decision to allow the naked girls to sleep with him.  Would Claire have been amused by this as well?  I don't think so.<br /><br />I assure you that I am no prude but it seems to me that in \\""A Breath of Snow and Ashes\\"" Ms. Gabaldon has abandoned romance and passion for light porn; traded clever and seamless integration of historical events, time-travel and a truly remarkable fictional romance for crass dialogue and indifferent adventures; and worst of all... forsaken the integrity of the characters - as well as her own painstaking and tender work in building those characters - for sensationalistic filler material.<br /><br />On the other hand I have long dreaded the conclusion of this series and the necessity of saying goodbye to so many beloved characters...

The first is that addiction is a choice, not a disease, and addicts always have it within their power to walk away. The second, which is a logical extension of the first, is that the belief in a Higher Power that 12 step programs require is simply another form of addiction, a fiction recovering addicts choose adopt to replace their drug addiction.

It would not surprise me if that person was arrogant, egotistical, sexist, or worse.  He himself suffered from this egotism to the point of contemplating suicide. <br /> <br />I think it's be safe to assume that the person that emerged from that single transformative experience, lived his teaching for twenty years and began to write it down only recently, bears little relation to the person you knew. <br /> <br />Though I've never met Mr. Tolle, I can imagine that the personality of a fully-realized, or \\""enlightened\\"" human being might still manage to offend certain people.  The enlightened state is one of both detachment and great compassion; ironically, the detachment of egolessness can easily be misinterpreted as egotism.  I believe Ramana Maharshi appeared that way to some.  See the Tao te Ching (Stephen Mitchell translation) for a more detailed description of such a person. <br /> <br />And once again, even if Mr. Tolle could not embody his teaching 100% of the time, it detracts nothing from his works.  The proof of the value of his teaching lies in the lives transformed by it, such as mine, from one of brooding, self-involvment, and pain, to lightness, joy and ease.   <br /> <br />Pick up a copy and give it a try.  Just keep reading it, and try to live with the teaching.   <br /> <br />Review: I have not read this new book yet, but thus far the original is my favorite book.  I can go back time and again.  In Stillness Speaks, Tolle experimented with a more concise, poetic style that I believe did not suit him as well as his extended discourses.  From the sounds of things, his new book goes back to that original style.",10/12/2005

Just like Tolkien, Paolini's first book Eragon is but the first chapter, it's exciting and, like The Hobbit, a mere begining.  In my opinion, as the second chapter to the Inheritance saga, Eldest far surpasses Tolkien's Fellowship of the Ring.

It surprised me though, thatI indeed enjoyed it, because of the title being so very similar to Tolkien's Aragon. I thought, probably like many, what kind of cheesy foolish repeat or 'Ode to Tolkien' can this be? But low and behold I was wrong. It proved to have a heart of its own and one with its very own creative pulse. It had a simple yet deeply enticing grace that seemed to sweep me away. I was thoroughly entertained, and impressed, save for the last predictable battle scene, which left a little to be desired. Eragon seemed to lose steam towards the end. It became more 'actiony' and 'predictable', and less naturally enticing. <br />     <br />   And that should have warned me to have lower expectations for the second book. It is very difficult to continue one's success with \\""series\\"" fiction. I commend Rowling, Tolkien, and many others for succesfully doing such. This second book definitely trails off. It loses its speed, and strands itself in a sea of tedious boredom, predictability, and bland complexities. <br />    <br />   Eldest seems to grow an opinionated outside critique on life. It doesnt't feel natural at all, nor does it fit in with the initial heart of the story that compelled me in. I can hear way too much of the author's voice, and opinions in this. And it feels forced.  It doesn't make any logical sense that the Elves who deal with \\""magic, energy, and a deep love of nature\\"" would be \\""Athiests\\"" or \\""Agnostics\\"".  I have no problem with Athiesm, nor Agnosticism, but it simply doesn't fit here. It feels out of place, and forced. I wonder if the author, being as young as he is, is unaware of various ideas of spirituality, religion besides beliefs in a \\""Personal God\\"", or \\""Personal gods\\"".  This was just one problem, out of many that I found in the book. But basically it is none of the little problems that I found troubling rather then the simple fact that the story in the second book is just not that good.  <br />   It is sad because Eldest in a way very much diminishes Eragon. The whole entire story has taken on this \\""video game-like\\"" quality where the characters have a certain amount of energy that builds up, gets depleted, and is restored. It feels at times like I am watching someone else play a fantasy video game. And, as we all know, that is not anyone's idea of a fun. <br />   <br />  I really wish that I didn't read this second book, for as I said before, it is no where close to as good as the first. I probably won't read the third. I will forget, by then, about how compelling the first book was, and will still have a sour taste in my mouth from this second book.    <br />  If you thought that the first book was absolutely excellent then give this one a try. It is mildly interesting, and your passion for the initial book should propel you through to the end...which again was quite predictable.  But if you found the first book to be average, or even slightly above average then I would recommend staying away from this book.  It is no \\""Godfather 3\\"" but it's pretty close.",10/12/2005

I first read Eragon right after finishing LOTR- big mistake.  Pretty predictable plot, and not nearly as well-written, I was cursing Paolini when I first started reading it- but in the end I really enjoyed Eragon for what it was, nonetheless.  I was really looking forward to the sequel, Eldest, and was ecstatic when it came out. <br /> <br />Now I don't want start off wrong here- I've read other reviewers' comments, and I think Paolini and Eldest are getting a pretty bad rap- the book wasn't THAT bad.  You want really bad fantasy- read \\""Dragonspell\\"" by Donita K. Paul (I still shudder when I think about that book, it was so awful).  I actually finished Eldest anticipating the third one, so that's a good sign.  Still, a few valid points were definitely made: <br /> <br />1) Mixture of LOTR and other fantasy classics- this is definitely true.  But hey, you gotta start out somewhere, right? <br /> <br />2) Forced vocabulary- most blatant of all, if you ask me.  This book is an EXCELLENT resource if you are studying for the GRE, because I swear, there are SO MANY words here from the Princeton Review GRE study guide.  You might say \\""Oh well, he's just utilizing more of the English language; tough cookies if you can't understand it because your vocabulary is limited.\\""  I might be inclined to agree with you if he didn't use so many together- but 50-60 words that I've only seen on that GRE vocabulary list alone (and I consider myself pretty well-read)?  Come on.  If he did purposefully pull words out of the Princeton Review vocabulary list, then that's fine, but he used them in such a way that it just seemed forced many times- I mean come on, who uses the word \\""chary\\"" in place of \\""wary\\"" or \\""cautious\\""?  Just say \\""wary\\""! <br /> <br />3) First part of the book is boring- man, do I agree with that one.  I'd venture that the first 75% of the book was pretty much boring- it only got really good towards the end.  It usually takes me between 3-10 days to finish a book, depending on how good it is.  It took me a month to finish Eldest, because it was so hard to stay interested.  One reviewer said if you can make past the first 2/3 of the book, you'll be good.  Change 2/3 to 3/4, and I'll agree. <br /> <br />4) Way too long- definitely.  I don't mind a long book if it's content is good.  But so much could have been cut out- many lengthy descriptions of things that didn't need describing weren't valuable to readers like me. <br /> <br />5) Eragon evolves too much in one year- yes!  I mean, we go from a 15-year-old farmer kid who didn't know squat, to a 16-year-old who is able to make political decisions on his own?  I mean, by the end of it, Eragon is speaking like a man in his mid-40s.  I know that he has been through a lot, but the change is a little bit much. <br /> <br />6) I'm going to add one here- Roran's plot.  A nice attempt, but this man suggests way too many crazy schemes, which is fine- but my problem is that the whole village follows him EVERY SINGLE TIME.  To me, that is just not realistic.  Period. <br /> <br /> <br />Overall, it's a decent read, and Paolini has talent, although not yet fully-developed.  I understand that it is the second in a trilogy, and as seconds go, it is not going to be the most exciting read, as it is just a preparation for the last book.

This is not overanalyzing the story but rather just looking at where Paolini could have improved. You can't help but see this. I am surprised that Knopf published the book without catching these errors, even more so because the book was to be marketed to teens and older children. On the other hand, Eragon is a great book, especially since it was written by a 15-year old, not 17. The marketing of the book did not make it popular; many books have been advertised a lot and still turn out to be flops. What made this book popular was that it was a book that could not be put down. Nobody buys the second book (Eldest) unless he or she liked the first, so nobody can say the book is popular because of marketing. People like it because it's a good thriller/ imagination stimulator. It's just not a book that you can stop. Eragon could have been better, but that doesn't make me think that it's the worst book in the world like some other reviewers have pointed out.<br /><br />The major conflict that plays into the climax isn't introduced until about halfway through the book. By then your thinking that the conflict and the climax will be dealing with the Ra'zac, but no. I'm not telling who, but a new character is introduced halfway in the story and the entire story takes a left turn from there. If you've already read both Eragon and Eldest, then you know that the Ra'zac conflict will continue in Eldest, but no clues in Eragon give that away.<br /><br />One more point I'd like to make is in retaliation to another review written recently. What teenager wouldn't want to be published if given the chance? He or she would have a voice in the world, something few teenagers and young adults have. Being successful may be a matter of opinion, but I just don't buy the fact that not all teenagers want to be published. Getting published is the same thing as saying that your writing stands out above most other writings in the nation. You are now a nationally known celebrity. What teenager wouldn't want that?<br /><br />One more thing is that you have all these reviewers giving Eragon 5 stars when all they say is that its a really great book. Can anyone explain WHY it's a really great book? (Not just that it's a page-turner)<br /><br />The movie Eragon is set to release in July 2006.

US,52663421,R1GOSNP8PZNLBS,375826688,342317933,Eragon (Inheritance),Books,2,8,10,N,N,Superfluous fantasy,"The problem here isn't really that Paolini has pilfered other authors' ideas.  That, in itself, wouldn't be a problem if the story, characters and dialogue were engaging.  I happen to find The Sword of Shannara a fun read, even though it lifted nearly every character archetype and concept from Lord of the Rings (a charge which Brooks denies, btw).  But Terry Brooks was able to make the world of Shannara unique or at least somewhat his own (Brooks also wrote some other good Shannara books, such as Elfstones of Shannara).  I'm not saying Brooks is a tremendous author, but his works have at least something to offer.<br /><br />But Eragon's characters and story aren't engaging, his world suggests nothing uniqe and the book is not particularly well written.  With so many disparate elements pulled from other works, he has created a sort of \\""Frankenstein's Monster\\"" of fantasy novels.  The book is rather hodgepodge; there is no backbone, no weight, no glue.  At least it has none of its own but tries to assume that of other books, almost through osmosis.  Ideas are taken from other works (the names of which have already been mentioned ad nauseum) and just sort of inserted. It has a sort of \\""write-by-numbers\\"" feel to it.<br /><br />The story lacks a strong sense or weight of history, though the author tries to effect such throughout the book.  Things just sort of happen because they're supposed to according to the usual fantasy story template not because the author had any particular vision.  The result is, unfortunately, artificial.<br /><br />For example, the boy Eragon becomes a so-called (and quite accomplished) Rider before the reader even gets a sense of or appreciate what a Rider is (assuming they're unfamiliar with McCaffrey's Pern series, that is).  Also, concepts and past events are exposited to no end and too quickly as the story moves along, giving the work a rushed feel.  Even the initial \\""quest\\"" is rather weak, involving nothing more than a desire for revenge by Eragon (and an uninteresting episode or two that involves looking up shipping records).  This is the hook by which Eragon ultimately becomes the \\""chosen one\\"" (or a chosen one) and it's pretty non-compelling stuff.  The stilted dialogue and lack of humor in the book doesn't help.<br /><br />All this is understandable for a young author.  I'm sure ever aspiring author has done something of the same for his/her first stab at writing fantasy.  The problem with Paolini's book is that someone went and published it.<br /><br />Another point I'd like make (and which has raised by others) is I'm wondering why this is being sold as a children's book.  Even in adult fantasy, call me crazy, but I'm not sure the sight of an impaled baby is something readers necessarily want to conjure in their minds.  Such a sight would almost be a shock even in George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series.  Presumably, it's to make the as-yet unseen villain to be as evil as possible, but it's forced, excessive and reeks of shock value.  If you have to resort to such blatant tactics to make your villains despicable, you're on the wrong track, imo.  There are other graphic descriptions of violence in the book that seem out of place in what is allegedly a children's book.  Again, this is understandable in the sense that the writer hasn't even come close to perfecting his craft.  But someone told him his book was good (his parents, in fact) and they went and published it, so there's little chance that Paolini will improve his skills as a writer (especially as he is alleged to ignore criticism - good and bad), if his books keep making the bestseller list.<br /><br />I did see potential in the book and there were some passages I actually found somewhat interesting.  Unfortunately, the overall concept is just too derivative and the potential is never truly realised.  The idea needed further development, ingenuity and lots of rewrites.<br /><br />A few final thoughts:<br /><br />I'm curious as tothe frequent comparison in these reviews between the name Eragon and Aragorn of Lord of the Rings.  The resemblance is superficial, nothing more, and there is little resemblance between the two characters.  If anything, there would seem to be a greater resemblance between Eragon and Dave Edding's Garion (perhaps another name to add to the list of ideas that Paolini borrowed); the archetypes appear to be similar there (I say 'appear' because I've not read anything of Eddings), as do the names (if you substitute the 'e' in Eragon, with an 'i,' you can spell 'Garion').<br /><br />As far as his borrowing other ideas, he's not the only one.  Besides the previously mentioned authors, Star Wars itself is hardly an entirely unique story, having borrowed from such works as LotR and the movies of Akira Kurosawa.  It's not the fact that Paolini pilfering these concepts from others, it's that he's not doing anything interesting with them.  Again, the amateurish feel of the work is entirely understandable.

It simply gives a couple of snapshots of society and talks about why or how these people make money, or organise their lives.

Each day begins with Harry, Ron, and Hermione checking the obituary section of the newspaper for familiar names. Death Eaters are murdering people and Voldemort's return grows nearer. Teenage drama occurs between the main characters and this includes love and hate. The biggest shock of the entire series lies within the last couple chapters of this book.       This was the best Harry Potter book yet! J.K. Rowling's style is like no other. Her description of the setting and characters in this book is just amazing. No matter where she takes you in her books you can picture yourself there. When I read her books I see the Hogwarts castle, Hogsmeade, and the Forbidden Forrest in my mind. Each setting she creates evokes a different emotion. When Harry is at the Dursely's house you feel his isolation and loneliness. Then when he arrives at Hogwarts or the Burrow you too feel his sense of belonging. Rowling's ability to write round characters is also outstanding. Each of them has depth and significance. You come to know her characters and start predicting their reactions to the situations she creates in the story. You also start predicting what will happen with the characters in the next book. Harry, of course, is the most developed character. I love Rowling's books because you really see Harry Potter grow up. From book one to this you see his personality evolve. His humor changes, he starts to form views on issues, and he experiences new emotions and the whole time it feels as though you're experiencing them with him. J.K. Rowling's style is very unique and not like anyone else's. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a must read as well as the rest of the Harry Potter series.",10/12/2005

Every book has something original about itself and as the story progresses, the characters grow more mature and deep, as well as the story itself grows darker. <br /> <br />The Half-Blood Prince reaches the crucial moment in which everything is set for the final battle (book 7). The possibility of vitory as well as the growing conflict are placed and \\""the board is set\\"" so that the next chapter focuses in conclusions and answers. <br /> <br />Rowling keeps surprising me with her writting so easy to read for a kid and still enyoable for an adult. The dialog is smart and funny when it needs to be, and the plot thickens as it becomes a little more mature. <br /> <br />Mystery is key to Harry Potter novels, and this chapter presents some answers to past mysteries in the series as well as new mysteries (\\""R.A.B.\\"" - those who have read it get me). <br /> <br />The evolution of some characters like Snape are amazing, and once again Rowling provides with a smart and fun plot to follow, although this time, it's a little more dense.  <br /> <br />Unlike the previous books, this one starts different (no Harry's prespective, but a narrator point of view) and the complexity of concepts and twists rises (a lot of memories regarding Voldemort's quest for immortality, as well as explanations about how his mind and his approach to magic works). The sixth book is defenitly the most mature of the series so far, leaving even Phoenix behind in terms of darkness and complexity. <br /> <br />The series has reached a point where everything is uncertain regarding the future and the past, and Harry certainly grows up here. This may not be the best of the series, but it is indeed the step needed to conclude the story next book, as this one sets everything up for the next chapter to flow. <br /> <br />Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is an amazing piece of fantasy, teen issues, smart and fun dialog, character development and revelations that build the pillars needed to conlude the series with a bang.",10/12/2005

(SPOILER) The highlights of this book is the blossoming romance between Ron and Hermione. Also Harry and Ginny. Mrs. Rowling developing each characters so well.<br /><br />Some of you probably hate this book cause it still leave us with so many questions at the end of this book. That's the brilliant of Mrs. Rowling. If she answered all of the question now, there will be no surprise twist anymore in the final book. Not to mention we are not so eager to step in line for hours to buy the book the minute it been release so we can find the answers we hope for.<br /><br />Few questions that we are dying to know the answers in the seventh book are:<br /><br />1. Is Snape a member of  Lord Voldemort  team or not?<br /><br />My prediction: Not! He is still loyal to Prof. Dumbledore. Why? Simple enough. The bad team had more strong members compare to the good side. Snape probably the strongest wizard after Lord Voldemort and Dumbledore. It will be nice if Snape on the good side helping Harry although they dislike each other.<br /><br />2. Is the character who died in the sixth book really dead or not? My prediction : Unfortunately Yes. Why? Cause since the fourth books of Harry Potter, there was always one character dead.<br /><br />3. The most important question of all. Since book fourth, there was always one character dead. In Book 4, a character dead. Book 5, an important character dead. In Book 6 a VERY important character dead. So in Book 7, probably the most important character will die. The question is who? Harry or Lord Voldemort?<br /><br />And after I read all sixth of really good Harry Potter books, I am sure that Mrs. Rowling can write a real satisfying final book of this magnificent series.fying final book of this magnificent series. <br /> <br />",10/11/2005

If you are more of a fast-paced person, this story just isn't for you. I'm the sort of person that ends up underlining bits in my paperbacks and waking up in the middle of the night to see how something was worded.  I owe Jordan a lot. I started reading Eye of the World a couple years ago and my own writing moved from really sucking to only mild suckage. If I could read all of the 8,000 pages I've heard are first presented for editing for each book, I would. I recommend reading each book twice. Once to read it over and know the plot, and the second time should be thorough to the point of anal-ness. This prepares you for discussion with the other members of our breed. <br /> <br />On the actual specific book. . . . <br />Overall, the plot moved forward at a pretty suitable pace. I am sad to see the world in a downward spiral to Tarmon Gai'don, but all good things must come to an end. I'm most happy with the advancements in character given to Mat, Tuon, Nynaeve, and Egwene. Mat's always been my favorite character, but Knife of Dreams really gave him yet another layer that was done really tastefully.  There is a Tuon POV, which helps build her, and she's fast gaining respect in my eyes.  There are a couple scenes with Nynaeve dealing with Lan that just made me tear up, but I really love those two! <br /> <br /> <br />",10/14/2005

In fact, he almost single-handedly turned me off of fantasy as book genre.  <br /> <br />Despite his last few failures, this book actually does alright in moving plot forward granted a bit slowly.  It sucks he ignores Rand, but frankly Rand is a bit annoying to me anyway, so the focus on Matt was a welcome change.  His writing had a bit more action than his last few flops. <br /> <br />However, in the grand world of writing, just because his last book was significantly better than his last few books, it doesn't warrant a five star rating.

Well, yes... specifically, that part where the Shaido clan-chief-wannabe was in the heart of Rhuidean and was tearing his eyes from their sockets rather than go on seeing what he was seeing.  Pretty much sums up my experience of reading book 10. <br /> <br />Knife of Dreams reminds me of book 4 in a different way - the story lines make PROGRESS.  Things happen.  Book 10 was painful, with the last chapter being the only required reading in the whole thing.  KoD isn't as good as book 4, though (IMO), because there are so many story lines.  In earlier books a story line would split off, but for every two leading off you usually had one or two coming back in.  But if you have 10 story lines (for example) sharing 700 pages, you obviously don't get as much progress made in each one as you would with just 4 to follow.  I understand that's the nature of the series at this point, but there you are - I'm less satisfied with the overall progress.  That said, what progress IS made has a much more furious pace that in recent volumes, reminding me once again of The Shadow Rising (ie, book 4) and leading me to a final rating of 4 stars.  I'd give it 4.5 if I could - it's really not the fault of this particular installment that it has so many story lines to deal with. <br /> <br />If this seems more like a review of the pace of the book than its content... it is.  Had the first couple of reviews I read indicated this was a repeat of book 10, I think I would have just went to message boards for plot summaries and spoilers rather than spend a few hours reading it.  When the series came out, I was in university and had much more time for reading.  Now I have a job and two kids, and I'm a different audience than I was back then ... I can't devote hours and hours of my life to reading a book that offers a few minutes of intrigue.  So the pace in book 11 was my number 1 concern.  Jordan has already shown he can weave an intricate and compelling tale, so that was never in doubt for me.

This is a habit of thought that may have been lost in urbanized modern society, though it wasn't too many decades ago that even American farmers were dependent upon animals for transportation and for work in a way that we are now dependent upon the internal combustion engine.  There are other books that do so (possibly Rudyard Kipling's \\""The Jungle Book,\\""; perhaps \\""The Lion King\\"", though I don't know \\""The Lion King\\"" very well; certainly American Indian  and apparently Hindu mythology.)The other novel that I have read recently that comes the closest to achieving this same effect is John Nicols' remarkable  \\""The Milagro Beanfield War\\"" which does so by also telling a very human story about traditional New Mexican farmers, and also, to a lesser extent, its sequel \\""Nirvana Blues\\"" which has certain elements of Hindu religion--in particular monkey worship-- as part of the plot. All of the above  anthropomorphize animals in a very positive way. \\""Life Of Pi\\"" does so by placing Pi on a liferaft in very close proximity with animal refugees from a zoo after a freighter sinks, and Pi, after losing his family,  also encounters numerous denizens of the sea, fish, reptile,mammal and fowl, on his 200-plus day ocean journey. In the early part of the book, Pi reflects on his early life as son of a zoo keeper in French India and the tone of respect for animals is consistent in these early sections as well, even when he describes why he believes animals are better off in zoos, than in the wild, or when hereflects on the personalities of animals.

The ending made me feel like I wasted my time reading the first 381 pages of the book. I thought the ending would tell more about Pi's adult life. In chapter 36, the reader is introduced to Pi's children. This gave me the impression that the end of the book would show how Pi went on with his life after the seven months spent in a boat with a tiger. I also was very confused on how in the beginning of Part II, Pi tells the reader that the sun had destroyed his clothes, but towards the end of his journey on the boat Pi tells the reader that he uses his shirt as a wet rag to put on his face to cool him down. How is it possible that the sun disintegrated his shirt in the beginning of the book, but Pi was able to use it again towards the end of the book? After reading the entire book, I was struck with numerous questions similar to the one above. I did, however, like most of the book. I found the beginning very interesting. I like learning about the three different religions Pi wanted to be. I was able to see the way Pi thought giving me a better perspective on three different religions. Pi helped me see how all of them had some factor in common. I also liked how Pi was a struggling young teen just like everyone else. He struggled with his name and which religion he should become. Many young teens struggle with similar issues. In the book, Pi shows the reader how he overcomes this struggle. He has the courage to go in front of his whole class and change his name.

Who wouldn't want to read about such an amazing story of survival. After Part II I was confident that this book was one of the best I had ever read, then the book eneded terribly. At the very end of the book you are lead to believe that the whole book was a lie. Pi gives you two different stories; the one with suriving on the boat with a tiger and the other one was about him surviving completly on his own, after the murder of three other surviors. I absolutely hated the ending it makes the book almost worthless to read. The ending was so disappointing and it ended leaving you wondering which story was true. The ending allows you to make the story what you want to make it and I honestly hate that. So I give this book a two because of the terrible beginning and ending.",10/11/2005
US,12097337,R37ZTL3JBWWFV5,156027321,843703088,Life of Pi,Books,4,1,2,N,N,Life of Pi,"Yann Martel's novel begins with an extremely bold declaration; that it is a story that will make you believe in God. Unfortunately, while the protagonist's almost unwavering faith and will to survive are inspiring, the core of the novel is hardly redeemed with its barely-there conclusion. This fantastical tale of a young boy and a comically named tiger trapped on a lifeboat is heartwarming at times, but the novel's unbridled visual imagery is not for the weak-stomached.  All in all, the novel's redeeming qualities most definitely outweigh its shortcomings and even if it doesn't change your mind on God, it will at least make you think a little about survival mentality.",10/11/2005

This book provided some great points for discussion about religion and survival but enough is enough. I felt that it was overly graphic and at times plain nauseatingly repetitive. I loved the character of Pi and the way that the author used vivid description and bold actions to really make him breathe, but I was very disappointed that his later life character was not more fully developed. The ending of this book is very disappointing. I wanted to know about the effect of the journey on Pi's life as an adult and the effects on his children. Making the audience question the validity of the entire story was not a good move. It distracts from the essential ideas of the book of faith and survival. I would recommend this book to others but with a bad taste in my mouth. It is a good solid read with a disappointing ending so be prepared.",10/10/2005

It opens the reader up to new horizons and forces him to dwell upon things that the average person would never normally experience. Pi's messages on religion and his insight about survival really engage the reader and give another outlook on life. It caused me to appreciate the life that I have. I agree with Pi's comment on the fact that everyone's mission is just to love God. In other words, what particular religion you belong to is not what is important. In my opinion, this was one of the main messages of the book, and I think that it is significant for everyone in all religions to realize this concept. However, I found Pi's constant struggle for survival to be quite repetitive after awhile, and at some times I became sick to my stomach. I also think that the two solutions offered in the ending, which the entire second part of the book led up to, caused the reader to lose trust in Pi's honesty. I don't think it matched up to the rest of the book, which is so good. That is what caused me to have mixed feelings about the book. But in general, I would recommend the book to anyone, because it is truly a remarkable adventure for Pi and a dramatic learning experience for the reader.",10/10/2005
